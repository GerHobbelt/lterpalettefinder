# lterpalettefinder

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `lterpalettefinder` is to provide high quality color
palettes derived from photos at LTER sites. This allows users to create
beautiful graphics that have close visual ties to photos from the places
where data were collected. This package also allows users to generate
their own palettes from any photo (.PNG only) if the current palettes in
the function do not meet their needs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `lterpalettefinder` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/lterpalettefinder")
```

## Functions

This package currently includes a few functions

-   `palette_find()` allows you to specify criteria for your desired
    palette and returns the palette(s) that we have already created that
    meet those criteria
-   `palette_extract()` allows you to extract hexadecimal codes from a
    picture of your choosing (only PNG format is currently supported)
-   `palette_demo()` allows you to quickly evaluate the colors returned
    by `palette_extract()` and export the demo plot if desired

## Palette Examples

This part of the README is in development so stay tuned!
